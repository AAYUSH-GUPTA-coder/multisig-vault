## MultiSig Dapp

Not everyone would understand that you how a template module will be merged with other one. For Multisig Wallet I wanted a vault which has interfaces for multiple token standards but the UI states that after adding ERC20 I can't add more. I understand why and how but I consider it is somewhat rigid.

- I was able to verify the ERC20 Token but NOT the Multisig template on testnet polygon scan. This was the module: https://app.bunzz.dev/module-templates/7ae98198-6b70-4d3b-8d54-048b1a78aa7d

The error was regarding ABI not having proper arguments.

- Made a simple UI for the token minting using Wagmi, rainbow kit and nextjs. Works perfectly.
